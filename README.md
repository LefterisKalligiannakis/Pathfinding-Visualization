# BFS Pathfinding Visualization

This is my first attempt at making some sort of algorithm visualization program. Now lets go through the features.

## Controls
To start the visualization you must add a start node (blue) and an end node (red). You can also add walls and make the map as complicated as you'd like. 

  - Start: hold 's' + left click or right click
  - End: hold 'e' + left click or right click
  - Wall: left click to add, right click to remove
  
### Options
	- Diagonals:
		The algorithm supports finding paths with diagonal moves. To enable this just check the 
		diagonals box.
		

	
	-Visualize:
		If you want to visualize the processing of the nodes by the algorithm
		check the visualize box.
